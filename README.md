# Project Name: TicTacToe_v2
Tic Tac Toe with a brilliant Bot to play against with three difficulty options as well as smaller bug fixes and quality of life changes. The Bot can be easily taken from this project to others because it uses no android APIs and uses pure Java. The project includes 21 tests for the Bot in many positions. Created by [mgurga](https://github.com/mgurga) and [thefluffyoshi](https://github.com/thefluffyoshi).

## Bot Difficulties
The Bot can be set to 3 different difficulties with different strategies. All Bot logic is stored in [tttAI.java](https://github.com/mgurga/TicTacToe_v2/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/tictactoev1/tttAI.java).
#### Easy
- Only makes random moves

#### Medium
- Makes random plays
- Plays winning moves if available

#### Hard
- First move is always strategetic(one of the four corners or middle square)
- Blocks the user from winning
- Takes wins when available
- Otherwise, only make random moves
